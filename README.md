HostelCheckIn
=============

A check in system for a hostel

The idea
-
Lately I have started to work in a youth hostel and I've realized that they are still checking in guests with
the oldschool paper/pen method.
This approach is very toilsome for the receptionsts, there is no elegant way to mend mistakes on paper and receptionsts 
relying on each others calligraphy to process information correctly. Not to mention that in the end of the day all of
those guests staying more than one night must be copied to the next day's check in list. This is just a waste of employees
time, provides surfice for additional errors and since there is a lot of paper involved in the paperwork,
it's harmful to the environment.

The app has to implement all the features that a receptionist might require during checking in a guest, such as:
check bed's availability, record guests' details, assign guests to beds, modify details of guests

<li>the application should display users staying more than one night on the following days' rosters as well</li>
</ul>
